                                    I had no idea about ALU, what it does and how things are done there.it was
                                    only through the time that i was offered my scholarship that i had to learn
                                    about ALU.This was the time then that i had to do more research on ALU.The
                                    first thing that got my attention was Leadership.A university offering other
                                    programs that had leadership course alongside and i thought this university
                                    might be a place for me to kill 2 birds with a stone.Hands on learning made
                                    me feel like i will be able now to achieve the curiosity that i had in technology.

                            wait for your first term to begin or whenever you have time.
